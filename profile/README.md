## Our mission

Our server exists for the purpose of welcoming and connecting developers of all skill levels all around the world, and help them help each other. We try to guide developers towards best practices, encouraging focus on accessibility, security and performance.

## Our GitHub

We're a big fan and supporter of open source, and have a lot of developers contributing to several big projects including WordPress Core. In our collaborative repository on GitHub, we will share anything we deem worth sharing. From code snippets and tutorials, to recommended and tested plugins and themes.
